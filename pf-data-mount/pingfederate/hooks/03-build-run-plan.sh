#- This script will building a run plan for the server as it starts up
#- Options for the RUN_PLAN and the PD_STATE are as follows:
#-
#- RUN_PLAN (Initially set to UNKNOWN)
#-          START   - Instructs the container to start from scratch.  This is primarily
#-                    because a SERVER_ROOT_DIR (i.e. /opt/out/instance) isn't present.
#-          RESTART - Instructs the container to restart.  This is primarily because the
#-                    SERVER_ROOT_DIR (i.e. /opt/out/instance) is present.
